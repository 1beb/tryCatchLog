How to apply this license

Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of your source code and copy the text of the license into the file.

Note: The Free Software Foundation recommends taking the additional step of adding a boilerplate notice to the top of each file. The boilerplate can be found at the end of the license.

Optional: Add GPL-3.0+ (or GPL-3.0 to disallow future versions) to your project's package description, if applicable (e.g., Node.js, Ruby, and Rust). This will ensure the license is displayed in package directories.
